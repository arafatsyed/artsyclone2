From your proposal to your phase 1 submission, you had a really nice progress, congratulations! Naturally, there is still room for improvement, and the comments below should help you with that.

The main page is excellently designed. I also love the gifs explaining the website, and also how things are arranged in general. However, when clicking on an art, a very weird interface appears, where the "Close" button and the artist's information is 100% default text, sometimes overlapping the image. This modal definitely needs some improvement. The modal appears again on the "Explore" page.

As it stands, it feels like you have dedicated a lot of time to the creation of the front page, which is good, but ran out of time when designing the other pages. You should definitely look at them a bit more carefully now, specially the "Login" page and the "Edit User" modal.

Because of how much thought you put into that front page and the very neat design of the top bar (i.e., you can go everywhere on the website very quickly), your User interaction is excellent.

However, your webapp is missing a "Register"/"New User" page. Even though registering users is done in the backend, the frontend should have been designed at this point.

<ins>The "Shop" page</ins> is looking really nice! One idea would be: after the user clicks on a selection, you move the screen to the next selection. For instance, I almost missed the final preview at the end, and was going to comment on its non-existence until I noticed that I could scroll down. So, in essence, it would be something like: click on a selection -> automatically scroll the view down a bit so that the next selection is displayed on the screen -> click on the next selection -> etc. Also, for the second selection (mugs, shirts, etc), it would be nice to have an orange background color, maybe even shaped like a wave, very similarly to what you did in the home page, maybe just copy and paste, but with more transparency, otherwise the orange color pops up too much. If putting an orange background behind the merchandise becomes difficult due to transparency issues on the images, just display the shirts/mugs first, and the art second, since you won't have background issues with the frames of the art. Anyway, this paragraph is too long for such a simple and possibly meaningless change, but it helps you use your brand's colors and make the page nicer.

<ins>Regarding your code:</ins> I do not see indication of server calls as comments in the code. If they are present but I didn't see them, please request a remark (you can just e-mail me. I still graded it as "Passable" though, as you can see). But I believe there is a bigger issue here in the sense that you replicated the User Profile component for each user. This is ok for a demo, but it will take you a lot more time to redesign the app so that it will be compatible with backend calls later in the next phase. It would have been better if you had one component for all users, and this component received the user information via props.

So, to wrap up, your project is looking very good and you are on the right track! There were just some minor slip ups that unfortunately I couldn't ignore since they're part of the marking scheme.
